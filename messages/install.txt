[x86 Highlighting scheme - Install Message]
    Hi, this is Calculuswhiz or Zach. Thanks for installing my highlighting scheme! I really appreciate it. If you notice any bugs, please let me know, or submit a pull request. For a quick demo, I have included some test files in the package. They are under the directory 'test/'. I have included a gdb disas log as well as some working programs. Check it out!

    If you have cool snippet ideas, please let me know as well!
    
    In case you missed it in the README, I do not have plans to support Intel syntax. Somebody's made one already, and it's not like you'd use both in the same file anyway. I mean, you *could*, but why would you?

    If you want to code in other editors, I have also ported the scheme over to Atom, Gedit, and Vim. Check out my repos!

    Thanks for installing!
    Zach
